#Project Goal: To create a program that requires a user input of a string (a-z), the program then returns the input as a string but reversed (z-a). 

def ReverseAString( s ):
	str = “”
	for i in s:
		str = i + str
	return str
	
s = input(“Enter a string that’ll be reversed:”)
print (“The entered string is: ”)
print (s)

print (“The reversed string is: “)
print (ReverseAString(s))
	
# The next project is programming a "Pig Latin" game.
